I was surprised that the isEven() and isOdd() functions had slightly different syntax. All of the functions had similar data structure.



The logic that challenged my thinking was the logic for the isOdd() function. I realized that the Boolean operator !== would return the opposite result of the === operator in the isEven() function.



This toolkit may be useful in the real world by providing a user with basic reusable functions that can be written into complex functions.
